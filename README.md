## Coding guidelines

- neither pascal case or camel case, we use snake case and meaningful names, within reason
- tab width is 4 spaces, no actual tabs
- opening braces are placed in the same line after loops and conditionals, otherwise they are placed on a line of their own
- the return type is placed on a line of its own
- closing braces are placed on a line of their own iff they are not followed by an <code>else<code/>
